Hi, I'm Pedro Pinto, a Computer Science graduate with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I work as a Desktop Engineer at the University of Greenwich, where I provide support for hardware and software maintenance, assist with IT needs during live academic sessions, and ensure all technical equipment and facilities are in optimal condition.

Previously, I completed my placement year as a Global Integrations Engineer at AWIN Ltd. During my time there, I significantly improved client integration processes, collaborated with analysts to enhance client on-boarding satisfaction, and integrated advanced tracking solutions to enhance data collection and user interaction analysis.

I have a passion for software engineering and machine learning. I am currently pursuing a career as a software engineer, with the goal of advancing to a more senior role within the next five years. Ultimately, I aim to integrate my interest in machine learning into my software engineering career, possibly working in a role that combines both fields.

Outside of work, I enjoy basketballâ€”both watching and playing. I also have a deep interest in literature, particularly enjoying poetry events and horror novels. Stephen King is my favorite author, and "The Shining" is a book I've read at least five times. I'm also an avid reader of fiction and science fiction.
