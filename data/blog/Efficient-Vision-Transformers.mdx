## Introduction

In the realm of machine learning, achieving high performance in computer vision tasks often requires a delicate balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The "Efficient Vision Transformers" project explores the adaptation of transformer architectures originally designed for natural language processing (NLP) to meet the demands of visual data processing.

Transformers, renowned for their capacity to capture intricate dependencies in sequential data, have demonstrated significant success in NLP applications. However, applying these models to vision tasks poses considerable computational challenges due to their large memory footprint and intensive computational requirements.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to adapt and optimize Vision Transformer (ViT) models to improve their resource efficiency without compromising accuracy. Key objectives included establishing benchmarks to evaluate the performance of optimized lightweight ViTs in terms of accuracy, inference time, and memory usage.

The optimized ViT models were evaluated in practical settings, specifically within OpenAI Gymâ€™s Pong game, to assess their operational efficacy in terms of robustness, responsiveness, and energy efficiency. This evaluation aimed to gauge their potential to reduce energy requirements in AI operations and enhance accessibility to advanced AI technologies on less capable devices, thereby promoting sustainability and digital equity.


## Method 

Since these methods focus on optimizing Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures initially designed for natural language processing (NLP) for visual data tasks.

The process begins with pre-training the ViT models using supervised learning on expert-labeled datasets before exposing them to interactive environments. The following code snippet demonstrates how to generate expert data.


```python

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import cv2
import gym
import os

ROWS = 80
COLS = 80
REM_STEP = 4
state_size = (REM_STEP, ROWS, COLS)

def GetImage(frame, image_memory):
    if image_memory.shape == (1, *state_size):
        image_memory = np.squeeze(image_memory)
        
    frame_cropped = frame[35:195:2, ::2,:]
    if frame_cropped.shape[0] != COLS or frame_cropped.shape[1] != ROWS:
        frame_cropped = cv2.resize(frame, (COLS, ROWS), interpolation=cv2.INTER_CUBIC)

    frame_rgb = 0.299 * frame_cropped[:,:,0] + 0.587 * frame_cropped[:,:,1] + 0.114 * frame_cropped[:,:,2]

    frame_rgb[frame_rgb < 100] = 0
    frame_rgb[frame_rgb >= 100] = 255
    new_frame = np.array(frame_rgb).astype(np.float32) / 255.0

    image_memory = np.roll(image_memory, 1, axis = 0)
    image_memory[0,:,:] = new_frame

    return np.expand_dims(image_memory, axis=0)


def reset(env):
    image_memory = np.zeros(state_size)
    frame = env.reset()
    for i in range(REM_STEP):
        state = GetImage(frame, image_memory)

    return state


def step(action, env, image_memory):
    next_frame, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    next_state = GetImage(next_frame, image_memory)

    return next_state, reward, done, info


env = gym.make('PongDeterministic-v4')

render = True

for episode in range(0, 10000):
    score = 0
    done = False
    
    state = reset(env)

    episode_list = []
    action_list = []

    state_list = []
    while not done:
        if render:
            env.render()

        prediction = model(input_1 = tf.constant(state, dtype=tf.float32))
        prediction = prediction['output_1']
        
        action = tf.random.categorical(prediction, 1).numpy()
        action = action[0]

        next_state, reward, done, _ = step(action, env, state)

        episode_list.append(episode)
        action_list.append(action)
        reward_list.append(reward)
        done_list.append(done)
        step_list.append(step)
        state_list.append(state)

        score += reward
        state = next_state
        
    save_data = {'episode': episode, 'step': step_list, 'state': state_list, 
                 'action': action_list, 'reward': reward_list, 'done': done_list}

    save_path = 'expert_data/pong'
    save_file = 'data_' + str(episode) + '.npy'
    path_npy = os.path.join(save_path, save_file)
    isExist = os.path.exists(save_path)
    if not isExist:
       # Create a new directory because it does not exist
       os.makedirs(save_path)
       print("The new directory is created!")
    
    np.save(path_npy, save_data)
        
    print("episode: {0}, score: {1}".format(episode, score))
