# Distributed Systems

Distributed systems can be viewed from various perspectives.
From the *physical* perspective, a distributed system consists 
of multiple machines communicating over network links.

At run-time, a distributed system can be seen as processes
communicating via inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms,
such as HTTP, hosted on different machines.

At the implementation level, a distributed system comprises
loosely-coupled components that can be scaled and deployed
independently. These components are referred to as services.

A service implements a specific part of the system's overall
capabilities. At its core, a service contains the logic for
exposing interfaces used to communicate with the outside world.

Interfaces can be classified as inbound, defining the operations
that the service offers to clients, and outbound, defining the
operations that services use to communicate with external services
, such as data stores and messaging services.
