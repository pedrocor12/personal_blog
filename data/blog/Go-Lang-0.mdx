Every Go program is made up of packages. Similar to other languages where by convention we start running the program in the main package, in Go the same happens.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "math/rand"
)

func main() {
  fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}


The program above is using packages fmt and math/rand. By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. In the example above, package math/rand comprises files that begin with the statement package rand. In the example above, rand is the package for random numbers where Intn returns an int, a non-negative pseudo-random number in the half-open interval [0,n). It panics if n <= 0.

Imports are grouped in parenthesized, "factored" import statements. However, we can also do imports in the following format:


```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package:

* pizza and pi do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

* When importing a package, we can only refer to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

* A function in Go can take zero or more arguments. We can notice that the type comes after the variable name.


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
  return x + y
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```


We can omit the type when two consecutive named function parameters share a type.

```go
// instead of
x int, y int
// we can write
x, y int

func add(x, y int) int {
  return x + y
}
```

A function can return any number of results.
```go
func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
  return y, x
}
```
The swap function returns two strings
