Every Go program is made up of packages. Similar to other languages where by convention
we start running the program in the main package in Go the same happens.

```python 
package main

import (
  'fmt'
  "math/rand"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}

```

The program above is using packages 'fmt' and 'math/rand', by convention
the package name is the same as the last element of the import path, in the 
example above package 'math/rand' compromises files that begin with the 
statement package rand in the example above rand is the package for random
numbers where Intn returns as int , a non-negative pseudo-random number in 
the half-open interval [0,n) according to the source code. It panics if n <= 0 .

Imports are grouped in parenthesized, "factored" import statements. However,
we can also do imports in the following format:

```Golang
import "fmt"
import "math"

```
