Every Go program is made up of packages. Similar to other languages where by convention we start running the program in the main package, in Go the same happens.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "math/rand"
)

func main() {
  fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```

The program above is using packages fmt and math/rand. By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. In the example above, package math/rand comprises files that begin with the statement package rand. In the example above, rand is the package for random numbers where Intn returns an int, a non-negative pseudo-random number in the half-open interval [0,n). It panics if n <= 0.

Imports are grouped in parenthesized, "factored" import statements. However, we can also do imports in the following format:


```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package:

* pizza and pi do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

* When importing a package, we can only refer to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

* A function in Go can take zero or more arguments. We can notice that the type comes after the variable name.


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
  return x + y
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```


We can omit the type when two consecutive named function parameters share a type.

```go
// instead of
x int, y int
// we can write
x, y int

func add(x, y int) int {
  return x + y
}
```

A function can return any number of results.
```go
func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
  return y, x
}
```

The swap function returns two strings.

Go's allows for values that are returned to be named. if so, they're treated as variables
defined at the top of the function 

```go

package main

func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum * 4 / 9
    y = sum - x 
    return
  }
```
The names are used to document the meaning of the return values.
* A return statment without arguments returns the named return values
* This is known as a "naked" return.

Naked return satements should be used only in short functions,
as the example shown above. They can harm readability in longer functions.

We can declare a list of variables, as in funcitons argument lists, the type is last


```go 

import "fmt"

var c , python, java bool 

func main() {
    var i int 
    fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
  }
```
As values printed were not assigned values , notice that when printed to the console,
it returns a 0 , and for the c, python, java returns false as values that are not assgined 
a value will return 0

## Variables with Initializers 

Variables can include initializers
* if the initializer is present the type can be omitted

```go 
package main

var i, j, int = 1, 2 

func main() {
    var c, python, java = true, false , "no!"
    fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
  }
```

## Short variables declarations

Inside a function we can use the := short assignment instead of using the var
declaration with implicit type.

Outside the function, every statement, begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) 
and so the := consturct is not available. 

```go 
package main 
import "fmt"

func main() {
    var i, j int = 1, 2 
    k := 3 
    c, python, java := true, false, "no!"
    fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
  }
```


## Basic types

```go 
bool

string 

int int8 int16 int32 int64

uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
    // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128
```

We can use the basic types and declarations factored into blocks 

```go 
var (
  a int 
  b string 
  c float
)
```
